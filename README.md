# Knapsack-GA
Solving the Knapsack optimization problem using **Genetic algorithm** with Python along with user interface (Qt)
## Requirement üì¶
The modules used in the program are placed in the requirement file along with the version.
You can easily install them with the following command :

`pip install -r requirement.txt`
## How to work
This program tries to optimize the contents of the backpack by using the genetic algorithm.
In each section, a part of the algorithm is implemented, which is as follows:

### Read Data from CSV üìÑ
The `find_CSV` figure out the name of the csv file that is included next to the program and then send
it to the `get_input` function. Here, the information is read from file and change in the form of three lines and they are
also given to the `clean_data` function to determine their type. and in the last step, the cleaned information is 
given to `rebuilde_stuff` function to create a tuple for each object and a list of tuples is given in the output.

### Creating the initial population ü•ö
In this ‚Äç‚Äç`initial_population`, with certain number of members of the population, start generating the initial population,
which represents the solutions For each chromosome defind here, we represent the presence of an object with **1** and the absence of that object with **0** So,
finally, we have a list of existence and non-existence of objects, which is a solution to the problem, whether it is good or bad.

### Parents selection üë´
By using ‚Äç‚Äç`selection` and a list of possibilities to choose a chromosome according to its fitness, we select parents.
Here we have four ways to choose a pair of parents : 
- Roulette-wheel
- Stochastic-universal-sampling
- Ranking
- Tournament

As a result of function, two chromosome is given as parents.

### Crossover üíï
By using the `crossove`r function and giving the parents and type of crossover, a new child or chromosome is produced
Here we have four ways to Producing a new child : 
- Single-point Crossover 
- 2-point Crossover 
- 3-point Crossover 
- Uniform Crossover

By repeating the **selection and crossover** stage, you get the number of population of a new generation with the specified population.
